# Sahil Kamble — Portfolio (v2)

This is a polished portfolio website scaffold for Sahil Gautam Kamble with improved visual design, case study modal, and OpenGraph tags for better previews.

## Files included
- `index.html` — updated site with hero, selected work, projects, case studies and contact
- `styles.css` — refined styles and responsive layout
- `assets/` — placeholder assets (preview image, resume placeholder)

## How to use
1. Download and extract the ZIP.
2. Replace `assets/resume.pdf` with your actual resume file (rename your PDF to `resume.pdf`). Also replace `assets/preview.png` with a 1200x630 preview image for social cards if you have one.
3. Upload files to your repository root via GitHub → **Add file → Upload files** and commit to `main`.
4. Enable GitHub Pages in Settings → Pages → Branch: `main` / Folder `/` → Save.
5. Visit `https://ssk-animator.github.io/Website-/` once published.

## Customization suggestions
- Replace the initials portrait with an actual headshot at `assets/avatar.jpg` and update HTML.
- Add detailed case studies (images, breakdown steps) inside `#projects` or separate pages.
- Add structured JSON-LD or a sitemap for SEO if needed.
